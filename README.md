# CruiseControl.NET
CruiseControl.NET is an Automated Continuous Integration server, implemented using the .NET Framework.

Fork for lightweight web dasboard, based on:
	[#Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy) MVC backend
	javascript SPA frontend.
	[Bootstrap v3.3.7](http://getbootstrap.com)
	[TableSorter 2.0 - Client-side table sorting with ease!](http://tablesorter.com)
	[Chartist.js 0.1.15](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/)
	[Knob: Nice, downward compatible, touchable, jQuery dial](https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob)
	
The main concern is to make tiny amount of repetitive pull communincations between server(broker) and client browser enabling near real time monitoring on slow networks.
