CruiseControl.NET is an Automated Continuous Integration server, implemented using the .NET Framework.

Fork for lightweight web dasboard, based on [#Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy) MVC backend, javascript SPA/jquery/Bootstrap frontend.
The main concern is to make tiny amount of repetitive pull communincations between server(broker) and client browser enabling near real time monitoring on slow networks.
